# Python tutorial
This is a basic tutorial on Python. We aim to cover general topics such as syntax and data structures, packaging, debugging, data loading and visualization. 

## Initial requirement
We encourage the use of Python in this course. You can download Anaconda, the open-source distribution supporting Python, following the instructions available on: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ 

This documentation also contains instructions on how to run and explore the Anaconda environment. Please have a look at it! 

## General instructions
Once Anaconda is installed, you will be able to run Python in a Jupyter Notebook. By doing so, you can now explore the .ipynb files attached to this tutorial. 

We urge you to complete the tutorial and test yourself with the built-in exercises. After doing so, carry out the proposed exercises in the instructions file.
